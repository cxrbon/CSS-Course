I am lerning about CSS in this course:

<h1>Lesson 1</h1>
<p>In CSS the color: is the property and the aquamarine is the value. Both (the property and the value) together are classed as a Declaration, and the whole thing from p is defined as a ruleset/rule!</p>

<h1>Lesson 2</h1>
<p>CSS works an specifity index, the rules that apply to a peice of code is dependant on the level of specifity of that code, i.e  id -> class -> rule</p>
classes are create by adding.{classname}.
id's are created by adding#{idname}.
