<h1>I am learning about CSS in this course:</h1>

<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
<p>In CSS the color: is the property and the aquamarine is the value. Both (the property and the value) together are classed as a Declaration, and the whole thing from p is defined as a ruleset/rule!</p>

<h2>Lesson 2</h2>
<p>CSS works an specifity index, the rules that apply to a peice of code is dependant on the level of specifity of that code, i.e  id -> class -> rule</p>
<p>Classes are create by adding.{classname}.
id's are created by adding#{idname}.</p>

<h2>Ch3: Colours in CSS</h2>

<p>RGB: allows to set specific colours aside from the ones that already given. 255 is max value for each place holder, i.e, rgb(255,0,0) is red.</p>
<p>RGB<u>A</u> scale: a (alpha channel) in this sets the trasnparency in the 4th placeholder. It goes from 0-1, 0 being fully transparent and 1 being fully opaque and 0.5 being 50% opacity.</p> 
<p> Hexadecimal color: using a scale of 0-9 and A-F, 0 being absence of colour and f being brightest value of that colour.</p>
<p>[coolors.coo](https://coolors.co) ==> a good website to get color palettes and check contrast between diferent colors</p>
